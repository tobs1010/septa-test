// Difference between Var, Let and Const
// var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped
// var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope;  const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
// var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
// var variables can be declared without being initialized.

// let variables are block scoped.
// let variables can be updated but not re-declared;
// let variables can also be declared without being initialized


// const variables are block scoped
// const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared
// const variables must be initialized during declaration

// JAVASCRPIT DATA TYPES
// Undefined: undefined is when a value is not assigned. If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:
// null: It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.
// Symbols: A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value.The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.
// Objects: Object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier.Objects are the only mutable values.
